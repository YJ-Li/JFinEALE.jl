# JFinEALE
Finite element toolkit in Julia

This toolkit is a redesign of the Matlab toolkit

fineale: Finite Element Analysis Learning Environment

JFinEALE is at this point very incomplete, at least compared 
to the original Matlab toolkit.  If something is missing, 
one can probably find it in the Matlab source code.
