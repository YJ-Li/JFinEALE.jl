# JFinEALE

Finite element toolkit in Julia

This toolkit is a redesign of the Matlab toolkit

[FinEALE](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEALE): Finite Element Analysis Learning Environment
  

JFinEALE is at this point very incomplete, at least compared 
to the original Matlab toolkit.  If something is missing, 
one can probably find it in the Matlab source code.

The author appreciates feedback and interaction/collaboration.
